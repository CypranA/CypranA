# Hello World! 👋

### I'm Cypran and welcome to my GitHub profile! 👨‍💻

- 👩‍🎓 Before switching to Data Analyst/Science, I was a finance and digital transformation enthusiast who got a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration (Banking and Finance).
- ✍️ Currently pursuing a Master's Degree in International Business with a speciality in Digital Transformation Management from Cologne Business School. 
- 📖 Self-learning through Google Certification Programs and DataCamp to improve my knowledge as a data scientist.
- ✨ I seem to be spending too much time designing my code and GitHub markdown because I cannot stand having sloppy documentation.
- 📈 My long-term interests span across **`Artificial Intelligence`**, **`Machine Learning`** and applying statistical models to solve interesting business problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GitHub
